            <h3>Sinopsis</h3>
            <p>Although Shirley Jackson’s published We Have Always Lived in the Castle in 1962, it remains one of the most popular horror novels of all time. The gothic plot follows the lives of 18-year-old Mary Katherine “Merricat” Blackwood, her older sister Constance and their Uncle Julian, who uses a wheelchair. The odd trio are the only people who survived an arsenic poisoning that killed John and Ellen Blackwood, Constance and Merricat’s parents, Dorothy, their aunt and their younger brother. Although six years have passed since the mysterious poisoning, the three have become comfortable living a reclusive lifestyle, which attracts a lot of gossip from the neighbors.</p>
